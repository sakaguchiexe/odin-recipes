# odin-recipes
This project was undertaken as part of the Odin Project curriculum.

During this project, I have been able to showcase the HTML skills I have learned 
so far. I have also practiced using git and become more comfortable with the 
software.

In order to create a functioning recipe website, I created an index.html page in 
the root directory of the project and added recipe pages (baked-beans.html, 
hamburger-buns.html and guacamole.html) to a separate directory called "recipes". 
These skills in properly organising a website will come in handy when I get to 
larger projects!

I have also successfully used both relative links (via the a href attribute to link 
the webpages together) and absolute links (via the img src attribute to link to images found on the All Recipes website).

Alongside this, I have successfully used both text elements (such as: h1, h2, p) to 
add content to the webpages, as well as using both ordered and unordered lists to specify recipe steps and ingredients respectively.

This project has allowed me to become more confident in using my HTML skills to create pages as well as using my git skills. In terms of git, I tried to focus on writing good commit messages, however one message uses a subject line containing the word "added" rather than "add" - an unfortunate mistake but a great learning opportunity for next time! I certainly feel more comfortable using git and can't wait to become even more familiar with the software in future projects!
