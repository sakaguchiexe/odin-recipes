        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ever wondered how to make this classic side dish? Well, worry no more!
            With this recipe you'll learn how to make your very own homemade baked
            beans (and hopefully realise just how much better they are compared to
            the store bought ones).
        </p>
        <p>Tender navy beans, molasses and maple syrup combine together to make
            the perfect rendition of everyone's favourite beans! So perfect infact,
            that they could even rival Heinz's! <em>You didn't hear that from 
            <strong>me</strong> though!</em>
