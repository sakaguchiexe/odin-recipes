    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ever wondered how to make this classic side dish? Well, worry no more!
        With this recipe you'll learn how to make your very own homemade baked
        beans (and hopefully realise just how much better they are compared to
        the store bought ones).
    </p>
    <p>Tender navy beans, molasses and maple syrup combine together to make
        the perfect rendition of everyone's favourite beans! So perfect infact,
        that they could even rival Heinz's! <em>You didn't hear that from 
        <strong>me</strong> though!</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For 10 servings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried navy beans</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp molasses</li>
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the navy beans into a large container and cover with several inches 
            of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Or, bring the beans and 
            water to a boil in a large pot over high heat. Once boiling, turn off the 
            heat, cover, and let stand 1 hour. Drain and rinse before using.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the beans in a large saucepan with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil 
            over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir the ketchup, 
            maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, 
            and chili powder together in a small bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Once the beans have simmered for 1 hour, drain, and reserve the cooking 
            liquid. Pour the beans into a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish and stir in the 
            chopped onion and the molasses sauce. Stir in enough of the reserved 
            cooking liquid so the sauce covers the beans by 1/4 inch.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Cover, and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the 
            heat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C), and cook 6 hours longer. Stir the 
            beans after they have cooked for 3 hours. Once the beans are tender and 
            the sauce has reduced and is sticky, remove from the oven, stir, recover, 
            and allow to stand 15 minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
