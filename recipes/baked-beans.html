    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ever wondered how to make this classic side dish? Well, worry no more!
        With this recipe you'll learn how to make your very own homemade baked
        beans (and hopefully realise just how much better they are compared to
        the store bought ones).

        <strong>me</strong> though!</em>
