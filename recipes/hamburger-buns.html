    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"My mum used to make these buns all the time at barbecues and parties - safe
        to say everyone enjoyed them! So much so that they refused to use the store-bought 
        ones and called my poor mother into the kitchen to make them!" - Bert Raye.
    </p>
    <p>Ever had a burger and realised halfway through that it'd be so much more 
        satisfying to eat <em>without</em> the soggy bottom bun that crumbles apart? 
        Well look no further (or actually, <em>do</em> look further down the page!) as this 
        recipe provides all you need to know on how to create the perfect, structurally 
        sound burger buns!
